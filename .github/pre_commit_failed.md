‚ùå **Pre-commit Hooks Failed**

Hi there! It looks like some pre-commit hooks didn't pass. To automatically fix these issues (if possible), simply run `pre-commit run --all-files` in your terminal. Make sure you have `pre-commit` installed and set up correctly in your Git hooks to keep your code consistent. Need more details? Check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/izzalDev/inno_build/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md) file for more info.
